## User Story
- As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Acceptance Criteria
- When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.
The user should be able to:

- Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

- Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

- View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the stats page.

- View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the stats page.
